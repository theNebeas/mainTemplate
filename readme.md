## **Readme summary:**
Write **readable and maintainable** code. Functions should be modular, reusable and **no longer than 60 lines**. Comment your code. Test before every push.

---

### **1. Modularity is Key**  
Break down code into reusable modules and components. Each module should have a single responsibility.

### **2. Aim for Readability**  
Write code that is easy to understand at a glance. Use meaningful variable and function names, and avoid overly complex logic.

### **3. Type Safety Matters**  
Check types rigorously, especially in dynamically typed languages. Use type annotations and linters to catch potential errors early.

### **4. Test, Test, Test**  
Do testing before every commit to ensure new changes don't break existing functionality.

### **5. Use Version Control**   
Use Git for version control. Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages. Follow branching strategies like GitFlow for collaborative projects.

### **6. Document Everything**  
Document code thoroughly. Use comments to explain why certain decisions were made, not just what the code does.

### **7. Keep Functions Concise**  
Limit function length to **10-60 lines**. Long functions are harder to debug and maintain.

### **8. Prioritize Performance**  
Write efficient code. Profile performance bottlenecks and optimize critical sections when necessary.

### **9. Stay Consistent**  
Follow coding standards and style guides. **Consistency across the codebase improves readability and reduces confusion.**

### **10. Continuous Improvement**  
Seek feedback, review code, and refactor regularly. Improve code quality incrementally and learn from mistakes.
